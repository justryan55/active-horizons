      <p>Ryan Irani</p>
      <p>Principal Physiotherapist and Director</p>
      <p>
        My name is Ryan, and I am the Director and Principal Physiotherapist at
        Active Horizons Health Group. I earned my Bachelor of Health Sciences
        and Master of Physiotherapy Practice from La Trobe University, Bundoora,
        in 2018. Since completing my studies, I have practiced physiotherapy
        across diverse environments, including private clinics, public and
        private hospitals, workplaces, community settings, and even through
        innovative telehealth services using virtual reality headsets. This
        broad exposure has allowed me to work with a wide variety of patients,
        each with their own unique health challenges and personal goals. I am
        particularly adept at managing intricate funding systems such as the
        NDIS. This expertise enables me to secure the necessary resources for my
        clients, optimising their therapeutic outcomes and helping them achieve
        their aspirations.

        My approach to physiotherapy involves a deep understanding of each
        individual, ensuring that every treatment plan is tailored to their
        specific needs and goals. I prioritise a holistic view of health,
        addressing not just the physical aspects but also considering the
        emotional and social factors that contribute to overall well-being.

        Outside of physiotherapy, I love to keep active by gymming and going for
        runs, which help me stay fit and energized. I have a passion for travel,
        always eager to explore new places, experience different cultures, and
        broaden my horizons. I believe in lifelong learning and continuously
        seek opportunities to expand my professional skills and knowledge.
        Additionally, I cherish spending quality time with friends, enjoying
        everything from relaxed get-togethers to exciting adventures.
