        Active Horizons Health Group was established in 2024 with a mission to
        revolutionise access to high-quality physiotherapy care. Recognising the
        challenges posed by long local waitlists, geographical remoteness, and
        mobility issues, we set out to bridge these gaps. Our innovative
        telehealth services are designed to minimise the time and cost of
        travel, ensuring that everyone can receive the physiotherapy care they
        need, wherever they are.
